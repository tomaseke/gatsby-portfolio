So I created a very minimalistic app that generates a random movie for you and you watch that. I used TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch the random movie. In the future I plan to create filters to customize the randomly generated movie.",

It tests your reaction time by changing the background color of the screen after a random time in range between 1-5 seconds and once the screen color changes, you should click the screen as fast as possible. After you click the screen, you will be shown your time. I plan to adjust your time for the refresh rate of your monitor and make a leaderboard to display results.",
